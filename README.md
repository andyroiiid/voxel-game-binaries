# voxel-game-binaries

Binaries for a voxel game (engine?).

You can download the whole repository [here](https://github.com/andyroiiid/voxel-game-binaries/archive/master.zip).

The zip file size is about 50MB.

**IMPORTANT!!!**

**This game uses [OpenGL 4.6 core profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL#OpenGL_4.6)
and [Direct State Access(DSA)](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Direct_State_Access).**

**It's completely possible to migrate the api to use OpenGL 3.3 core profile and DSA extensions. But for now please use
up-to-date GPUs to run this game. Here is a driver compatibility list from Wikipedia:**

```
NVIDIA GeForce 397.31 Graphics Driver on Windows 7, 8, 10 x86-64 bit only, no 32-bit support. Released April 2018
AMD Adrenalin 18.4.1 Graphics Driver on Windows 7 SP1, 10 version 1803 (April 2018 update) for AMD Radeonâ„¢ HD 7700+, HD 8500+ and newer. Released April 2018.
Intel 26.20.100.6861 graphics driver on Windows 10. Released May 2019.
```

**To put it simply, if you ever received any graphics driver update these two years, you are fine.**

**I didn't implement non-DSA workarounds, so there might
be [some driver bugs](https://blog.magnum.graphics/announcements/2020.06/#certain-gl-drivers-continue-to-be-a-hot-mess)
if you run it on Intel GPUs.**

# version 5 (the current version)

The current version of the game (engine). This version
requires [AVX2 instruction set support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#CPUs_with_AVX2).

Players are flying in this version.

Tried to implement some mining gameplay.

This version will randomly flip the textures to reduce repetition. I learned this technique from some minecraft mod
(I think it's OptiFine?).

Integrated the [FMOD](https://fmod.com/) sound engine.

The particles are GPU controlled.

```
1. set particles base location in uniform

2. glEnable(GL_PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE);

3. vertex shader: generate random movement with the gl_VertexID or gl_InstanceID
   and set gl_PointSize depending on the distance to the camera

4. fragment shader: use gl_PointCoord as texture uv

5. gl_DrawArrays(GL_POINTS, 0, particleNum);
   or glDrawArraysInstanced(GL_POINTS, 0, particleNum, instanceNum);

6. it's possible to batch render many particle systems with different textures
   using sampler2DArray and instance buffer
```

[The physics engine is slightly modified from version 3](#physics).

# version 3

The earliest version I could find binaries on my computers.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andyroiiid/voxel-game-binaries/master/screenshots/version-3-0.png" width=50% height=50%>

```
move: WASD
jump: space
left click: destroy block
right click: create block
quit: alt+F4
```

You can jump at any time (even in the air).

I implemented a [fake ambient occlusion effect](https://iquilezles.org/www/articles/voxellines/voxellines.htm) in this
version. This technique, however, is verbose to set up and introduces tons of problems when generating chunks with
multi-threading, so I didn't migrate it to the next version.

## Physics

The physics engine is a simple custom one written from scratch.

I didn't have an experience implementing a physice engine before. So it doesn't contain any broad-phase or narrow phase,
and it only supports collision detection and ray-casting. The collider on the player supports a behaviour similar
to [`KinematicBody.move_and_slide`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/classes/class_kinematicbody2d.html#class-kinematicbody2d-method-move-and-slide)
of the Godot engine.

Erin Catto has [a great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_nKOET6zwI) about how to implement physics engines. But I
only used some really basic techniques in this engine.

### Binary search for Time of Impact

TODO: illustration and when to terminate

### A simple way to implement ray-casting for voxel worlds

TODO: illustration and time profiling

The player has an AABB collider instead of a capsule.

# version 2

Version 2 is a rewrite of version 1 using raw OpenGL.

I still have source code for it, but the compiled executable seems to have some problems relating to dependencies.

I wrote a OpenGL api wrapper called `directgl` for it. It's
an [OOP (Object-oriented Programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) wrapper for the
OpenGL [DSA (Direct State Access)](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Direct_State_Access) apis.

It was an over-engineered version with tons of dependencies. I tried to use [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt),
which is a C++ [ECS (Entity Component System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) framework. Then I
realized that I didn't need it at all. I also used [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) for logging, and it
greatly slowed down the compilation speed. Logging with [SDL log](https://wiki.libsdl.org/CategoryLog) is enough for
most games.

# version 1

I couldn't find any file for this version.

I think they were on my self-hosted git server, but that server was long gone.

Version 1 is just some basic voxel world rendering written with the [magnum](https://github.com/mosra/magnum) framework.
